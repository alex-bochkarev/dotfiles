#+TITLE: AB/dotfiles -- my personal config repo.

This repo provides a brief description and actually keeps my customized personal
machine configuration (so that I could rebuild it quickly if necessary).

There are several folders relevant to the config, to keep everything tidy:

 | Folder                     | Description                               |
 |----------------------------+-------------------------------------------|
 | .config/                   | All config files and aux scripts          |
 | ⎣ spacemacs.d/             | Emacs configuration, from [[https://github.com/alex-bochkarev/my-spacemacs-dotfiles][a separate repo]] |
 | ⎣ ...                      | (everything else)                         |
 | .screenlayout/             | Screen layouts for =arandr=               |
 | .local/bin/                | Symlinks to user-level executable files   |
 | .icons/                    | Icons folder                              |
 | .themes/                   | Theme folder                              |
 | .fonts/                    | Fonts folder                              |
 | .mail/                     | Mail storage                              |
 | .local/share/applications/ | Apps' =.desktop= files                    |
 | Downloads/                 | Download folder (temporary)               |
 | opt/                       | Downloaded and installed programs         |
 | .cdg_paths                 | User dir bookmarks                        |

 I switched to managing my configuration with a separate repo and [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]],
 which seems to be really handy. (Got the idea from [[https://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html][here]].)

App sources (besides =snap=/=flatpak=) in the description below are annotated as
follows:

 |---------+-----------------------------------|
 | distro  | Debian repositories               |
 | git     | Official git repo                 |
 | release | (Binary) release from the website |

/Sidenote:/ perhaps, =xmonad= is the right way to customize the WM experience,
