#+TITLE: AB/dotfiles -- my personal config repo.

This repo provides a brief description and actually keeps my customized personal
machine configuration (so that I could rebuild it quickly if necessary).

There are several folders relevant to the config, to keep everything tidy:

 | Folder                     | Description                                    |
 |----------------------------+------------------------------------------------|
 | .config/                   | All config files and aux scripts               |
 | ⎣ spacemacs.d/             | Spacemacs configuration, from [[https://github.com/alex-bochkarev/my-spacemacs-dotfiles][a separate repo]]  |
 | ⎣ doom.d/                  | Doom emacs configuration, from [[https://github.com/alex-bochkarev/doom-config][a separate repo]] |
 | ⎣ ...                      | (everything else)                              |
 | .screenlayout/             | Screen layouts for =arandr=                    |
 | .local/                    | Symlinks and locally compiled software         |
 | .icons/                    | Icons folder                                   |
 | .themes/                   | Theme folder                                   |
 | .fonts/                    | Fonts folder                                   |
 | .mail/                     | Mail storage                                   |
 | .local/share/applications/ | Apps' =.desktop= files                         |
 | Downloads/                 | Download folder (temporary)                    |
 | opt/                       | Downloaded and installed programs              |
 | .cdg_paths                 | User dir bookmarks                             |

 I switched to managing my configuration with a separate repo and [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]],
 which seems to be really handy. (Got the idea from [[https://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html][here]].)

 Keyboard customization for Wayland lives [[file:hyper-key-wayland-gnome/.config/xkb/symbols/capslock][here]].
