* Current project TODOs
** koffer TODOs
- [ ] careful checking of the git repo status:
  + =git status -sb= shows both behind/ahead and new files!
- [ ] implement =unpack=
- [ ] maybe make proper =json= config for packing targets
  and =koffer add | list | remove= functionality

  perhaps, it will be easier to rewrite the stuff in python?
- [ ] also, checking the git repo permissions might be especially nice...
     or at least the instructions.

** TODO Describe multi-key setup
[2023-06-01 Do 12:23]
** TODO Add org-protocol setup!
[2022-08-13 Sat 11:09]

Things that required to do outside emacs config (I guess, just a =.desktop=
file? what else was it?..)

** DONE Check how to manage compiled Emacs with GNU Stow?           :someday:

- State "DONE"       from "LATER"      [2023-02-27 Mo 13:00]
** DONE Add =fzf-jump= related config files and other scripts

- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2022-12-21 Wed 19:11]
[2022-08-13 Sat 10:46]
Anything else besides =~/.cdg_paths=?.. Maybe put into some separate scripts?

Either way: I'd need to find a good place to these things in =~/opt=, otherwise
they will get lost. They used to live in =~/.config/abtools=, now in
=~/opt/ab-unixtools= and =~/opt/bin=.

* Notes
** Some files were symlinked to the originals in =~/.config=.
[2022-08-13 Sat 10:55]

 The following files are symlinked to the originals in =.config= folder:
 =.vimrc=, =.spacemacs=, =.mbsyncrc=, =.msmtprc=, =.Xmodmap=, =.Xresources=,
 =.xsession=, =.xsessionrc=, =.zlogin=, =.Renviron=, =.julia/config/startup.jl=.

 (Perhaps, not as relevant with Gnome.)
 
** TODO Add ignore files to GNU Stow
And add some app-specific notes, such as the =.authinfo.gpg= format.
